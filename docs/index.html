            <span>At the height of a barista’s craft lies the cappuccino. Dark, rich espresso lies in wait under a smoothed and stretched 
                layer of thick foam. Trained to know when each drink has reached a specific weight, 
                our baristas pass the test when the drink you hold in your hand is a perfect balance of light and airy foam and deeply 
                delicious espresso.
                <br>
            <br>With the layers more distinct, the coffee flavor is strong.
            <br>       
            <br>Baristas craft the latte in a very different way. The layers of espresso and steamed milk are mixed together and topped 
            with a light layer of foam. The drink is creamier and the coffee flavor is more subtle.<br><br><br></span>

                <br>
                Iced Coffee is brewed double strength then cooled, which creates a refreshing, lighter body. 
                It’s served sweetened, often with a splash of milk.
