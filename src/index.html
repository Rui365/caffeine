    <h2> Search interests in the past 15 years in the United States?</h2>
    <p>
        Change in search interests from 2004 to 2019:
        The search interest for "coffee" in the United States peaks almost every <strong> December </strong> from 2004 to 2018, except for 2011. The possible reason 
        could be people from all walks of life are busier and need to work harder at the end of each year.

            <span>At the height of a barista’s craft lies the cappuccino. Dark, rich espresso lies in wait under a smoothed and stretched 
                layer of thick foam. Trained to know when each drink has reached a specific weight, 
                our baristas pass the test when the drink you hold in your hand is a perfect balance of light and airy foam and deeply 
                delicious espresso.
                <br />
            <br />With the layers more distinct, the coffee flavor is strong.
            <br />       
            <br />Baristas craft the latte in a very different way. The layers of espresso and steamed milk are mixed together and topped 
            with a light layer of foam. The drink is creamier and the coffee flavor is more subtle.<br /><br /><br /></span>

            <span><br /><br /><br />Cold Brew is made without heat, which creates lower acidity for a smoother, naturally sweet taste.
                <br />
                <br />
                Iced Coffee is brewed double strength then cooled, which creates a refreshing, lighter body. 
                It’s served sweetened, often with a splash of milk.

        <span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Both equally refreshing, iced coffee has notes of caramel and cola, while the iced americano creates a wonderfully
