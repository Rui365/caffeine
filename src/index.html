                <p>At the height of a barista’s craft lies the cappuccino. Dark, rich espresso lies in wait under a smoothed and stretched layer of thick foam. Trained to know when each drink has reached a specific weight, our baristas pass the test when the drink you hold in your hand is a perfect balance of light and airy foam and deeply delicious espresso.</p>

                <p>With the layers more distinct, the coffee flavor is strong.</p>
                        
                <p>Baristas craft the latte in a very different way. The layers of espresso and steamed milk are mixed together and topped with a light layer of foam. The drink is creamier and the coffee flavor is more subtle.</p>

                <p>Both equally refreshing, iced coffee has notes of caramel and cola, while the iced americano creates a wonderfully rich cup with depth and nuance.</p>

                <p>Cold Brew is made without heat, which creates lower acidity for a smoother, naturally sweet taste. </p>
                <p>Iced Coffee is brewed double strength then cooled, which creates a refreshing, lighter body. It’s served sweetened, often with a splash of milk. </p>
