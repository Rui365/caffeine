            <span>At the height of a barista’s craft lies the cappuccino. Dark, rich espresso lies in wait under a smoothed and stretched 
                layer of thick foam. Trained to know when each drink has reached a specific weight, 
                our baristas pass the test when the drink you hold in your hand is a perfect balance of light and airy foam and deeply 
                delicious espresso.
                <br />
            <br />With the layers more distinct, the coffee flavor is strong.
            <br />       
            <br />Baristas craft the latte in a very different way. The layers of espresso and steamed milk are mixed together and topped 
            with a light layer of foam. The drink is creamier and the coffee flavor is more subtle.<br /><br /><br /></span>

            <span><br /><br /><br />Cold Brew is made without heat, which creates lower acidity for a smoother, naturally sweet taste.
                <br />
                <br />
                Iced Coffee is brewed double strength then cooled, which creates a refreshing, lighter body. 
                It’s served sweetened, often with a splash of milk.

        <span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Both equally refreshing, iced coffee has notes of caramel and cola, while the iced americano creates a wonderfully 
            rich cup with depth and nuance.<br />
